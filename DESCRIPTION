Description: Computes profile extrema functions for arbitrary functions. If the function is expensive-to-evaluate it computes profile extrema by emulating the function with a Gaussian process (using package DiceKriging). In this case UQ on the profile extrema can also be computed. It also provides different plotting functions to better locate excursion sets.
