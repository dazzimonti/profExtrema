Description: Computes profile extrema functions for arbitrary functions. If the function is expensive-to-evaluate it computes profile extrema by emulating the function with a Gaussian process (using package 'DiceKriging'). In this case uncertainty quantification on the profile extrema can also be computed. The different plotting functions for profile extrema give the user a tool to better locate excursion sets.
