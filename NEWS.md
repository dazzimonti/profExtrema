# profExtrema 0.2.1

## Changes with respect to profExtrema 0.2.0

* Fixed a bug in plots of coordinate and oblique profiles that was removing the possibility to change coordinate names in plots. 

* Fixed a bug in examples of the function approxProfileExtrema.

## Changes with respect to profExtrema 0.1.0

* New plotting functions such as `plotBivariateProfiles` and `plotOneBivProfile` give a more principled way to visualize bivariate profile extrema functions.

* updated univariate profile extrema plotting functions `plot_univariate_profiles_UQ` for more informative plots.

* non-coordinate profile extrema functions are now computed with a faster null-space method.

* Fixed many minor errors and bugs.
